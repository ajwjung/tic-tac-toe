# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Objective

To create a Tic Tac Toe game playable in browser and to practice writing code using the module pattern and factories. Full project details can be found at [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe).

### Specifications

**Requirements**

1. The gameboard should be stored as an array inside of a Gameboard object
    * There should be player objects and an object to control the flow of the game itself

2. Write a function that renders the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage

3. Build functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board. Players should not be able to play in a spot that is already taken

    * Add a display element that congratulates the winner
